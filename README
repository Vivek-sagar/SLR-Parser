PARALLEL SIMPLE LR PARSER
Implementation by Vivek v
#########################################################################

This is a standard SLR parser implemented using OpenMP

input.txt contains a simple set of production rules.

input2.txt contains a slightly more complicated production rule set.

Parser3.cpp Contains a serial implementation of the parser.

Parser3parallel.cpp Contains almost the same code as above, but with 
parallelization. The parallelization is far from perfect, but does provide
a small improvement in performance.

The rest of the files are just different versions of the program, and
don't serve any purpose for the final program.
